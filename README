For testing ideas to simplify and clean up some of the interfaces (e.g., the command
interface). We're trying to stick with only Verilog 2001. (SystemVerilog and VHDL have
their own abstract data types to do this a little more cleanly.)

I've settled on using macros to do the job. 

The downside of using macros is that they are in the global namespace, so collisions 
are possible. 

The solution is to give all macros descriptive and unique names. 

I'd prefer using something like a verilog function and localparam. The problem
I've run into is that functions an only return values, so you can't do things like
use a function to slice a vector on the left side of an assignment.
